"2024","Computer Science and Engineering","1","What is the worst-case time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm?","","O(n log n)","O(n^2)","O(n)","O(log n)","","","","B","In the worst case, QuickSort performs O(n^2) comparisons when the pivot always results in the most unbalanced partitions.","Algorithms","MCQ"
"","","2","Evaluate the integral ∫(2x dx) from 0 to 2.","4","","","","","","","","","The integral of 2x is x^2. Evaluating from 0 to 2, we get 2^2 - 0^2 = 4.","Mathematics","NAT"
"","","3","Which of the following are regular languages?","","Set of all palindromes over {a, b}","Set of all strings of even length over {a, b}","Set of all binary strings with an equal number of 0s and 1s","Set of all strings that do not contain the substring 'aa'","B","D","","","Option B is regular because even-length strings can be represented by a finite state machine. Option D is also regular because it can be recognized by a DFA.","Theory of Computation","MSQ"
"","","4","Which scheduling algorithm is non-preemptive?","","Round Robin","Shortest Remaining Time First","First Come First Serve","Multilevel Queue Scheduling","","","","C","First Come First Serve (FCFS) is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm where processes are scheduled in the order of arrival.","Operating Systems","MCQ"
"","","5","What is the output of the following C code?\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main() {\n    int x = 5;\n    printf(""%d"", x++ * ++x);\n    return 0;\n}\n```","","30","25","Undefined behavior","26","","","","C","The behavior is undefined due to sequence point violation as x is being modified more than once within the same expression.","Programming & Data Structures","MCQ"
"","","6","What is the probability of getting exactly two heads when flipping three fair coins?","0.375","","","","","","","","","The sample space is {HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT}. The favorable cases are {HHT, HTH, THH}, which is 3 out of 8.","Discrete Mathematics","NAT"
"","","7","Which of the following are properties of a binary search tree (BST)?","","The left subtree contains only nodes with values less than the parent node.","The right subtree contains only nodes with values greater than the parent node.","There are no duplicate values in the BST.","The height of a balanced BST is always O(n).","A","B","C","","Options A, B, and C are properties of a BST. Option D is incorrect because the height of a balanced BST is O(log n), not O(n).","Data Structures","MSQ"
"","","8","A CPU has a 5-stage pipeline. If a program has 100 instructions, how many cycles will it take to complete execution assuming no stalls?","104","","","","","","","","","The first instruction takes 5 cycles to complete, and each subsequent instruction takes 1 cycle. Total cycles = (n + (k-1)) = 100 + 4 = 104.","Computer Organization","NAT"
"","","9","Which of the following statements about NP-complete problems are true?","","All NP-complete problems are solvable in polynomial time.","If one NP-complete problem is solved in polynomial time, all NP-complete problems can be solved in polynomial time.","NP-complete problems are a subset of NP-hard problems.","The P vs NP question asks whether every problem in P is also in NP.","B","C","","","NP-complete problems are the hardest problems in NP, and if one can be solved in polynomial time, then all can be. NP-complete problems are also a subset of NP-hard problems.","Algorithms","MSQ"
"","","10","A relation R is reflexive if and only if:","","For every element a in the set, (a, a) '/∈' R.","For every (a, b) in R, (b, a) '∈' R.","For every (a, b) and (b, c) in R, (a, c) '∈' R.","For every element a in the set, there exists b such that (a, b) ∈ R.","","","","A","A relation R is reflexive if every element is related to itself, meaning (a, a) ∈ R for all elements a.","Discrete Mathematics","MCQ"
"","","11","What is the number of edges in a complete graph with 'n' vertices?","n*(n-1)/2","","","","","","","","","A complete graph with 'n' vertices has edges between every pair of vertices. The number of edges is given by n(n-1)/2.","Graph Theory","NAT"
"","","12","Which of the following protocols work at the transport layer of the OSI model?","","TCP","IP","UDP","FTP","A","C","","","TCP and UDP are transport layer protocols, while IP is a network layer protocol and FTP is an application layer protocol.","Computer Networks","MSQ"
"","","13","The decimal equivalent of the binary number 1011.01 is:","11.25","","","","","","","","","1011 in decimal is 11 and .01 in binary represents 0.25, so the total value is 11.25.","Digital Logic","NAT"
"","","14","What is the probability of getting at least one head when flipping two fair coins?","0.75","","","","","","","","","The probability of getting no heads (only tails) is (1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4). Thus, the probability of getting at least one head is 1 - 1/4 = 3/4 = 0.75.","Probability and Statistics","NAT"
"","","15","Which of the following are NP-complete problems?","","Travelling Salesman Problem","Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT)","Dijkstra Shortest Path Algorithm","Subset Sum Problem","A","B","D","","The Travelling Salesman Problem, SAT, and Subset Sum Problem are all NP-complete problems, while Dijkstra’s algorithm runs in polynomial time.","Complexity Theory","MSQ"
